# Quirkbot Compiler Stack
A stack that provides a service that compiles Quirkbot programs.

The service is divided into 2 processes: a webserver and compiler worker.

## Webserver
Takes in compilation requests (as c++ source code), and queues them in a database.

After a program has been queued and is waiting for compilation, clients can check query the compilation status by providing the build id.

*The programs will only be stored in the server for 15 seconds! Clients should request the compilation and check it's status immediately after.*
## Compiler worker

Reads queued compilation requests out of a database and compiles them. It doesn't serve any content to external clients.


# Requirements
- Node.js
- NPM
- Mongo

# Supported platforms
The service is depends on OS specific precompiled packages:
- [quirkbot-arduino-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quirkbot-arduino-builder)
- [quirkbot-avr-gcc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quirkbot-avr-gcc)

These packages simply mirror the files officially distributed by Arduino.

# Installation

### Clone repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Quirkbot/QuirkbotCompilerStack.git
$ cd QuirkbotCompilerStack
```

### Install node dependencies

```
$ sudo npm install
```

# Environment variables

### ```PORT```
ConfigureS in which port the server will respond to.

Defaults to ```8080```.

### ```MONGO_URL```
ConfigureS in which database the services will connect to.

Defaults to ```mongodb://localhost:27017/quirkbot-compiler```.

### ```WEB_CONCURRENCY```
The number of forks that will be spawned for each process.

On Heroku, it defaults to ```[Total available memory] / WEB_MEMEORY```
, so the best way to configure is to set ```WEB_MEMORY``` according to what is best for your dyno.

If ```WEB_CONCURRENCY``` is falsey, it will default to the number of cores of the machine.

# Initialization
### Database
If Mongo is not running, start it up with:
```
$ mongod
```
### Webserver
Start the webserver with
```
$ node server.js
```
### Compiler
Start the compiler worker
```
$ node compiler.js
```
# Updating
### Quirkbot Board and library
See `package.json`.
